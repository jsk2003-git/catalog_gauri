This project implements a simplified version of Shamir's Secret Sharing algorithm. It reads encoded polynomial roots from a JSON file, decodes them, and uses Lagrange interpolation to find the constant term (c) of the polynomial.

Files:
shamir_secret.js: JavaScript code to decode roots and calculate the secret constant term.
input.json: Input data in JSON format.
